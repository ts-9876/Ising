# Ising Model Simulations

This repository contains computational implementations of the Ising model to explore concepts in statistical mechanics and optimization. 

The Ising model is also adjacent to my senior research project involving Edwards-Anderson spin glasses.

- **Energy Minimization**: Code to minimize the energy of an Ising lattice using:
  - A **greedy algorithm** for basic optimization. This method tends to get stuck in local minima.
  - **Simulated annealing** for a more robust approach to escape local minima.
- **Metropolis Algorithm**: Implementation to simulate Ising model dynamics, producing a visual **GIF** of the lattice evolution. This gif shows my metropolis implementation at a low temperature.

More energy minimization techniques will be added in future updates!
