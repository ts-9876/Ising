# Ising Model Simulations

This repository contains computational implementations of the Ising model to explore concepts in statistical mechanics and optimization. 

**Metropolis Algorithm**: Implementation to simulate Ising model dynamics, producing a visual **GIF** of the lattice evolution. This gif shows my metropolis implementation at a low temperature.

More energy minimization techniques will be added in future updates!
