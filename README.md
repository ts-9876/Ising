# Ising Model Simulations

This repository contains computational implementations of the Ising model to explore concepts in statistical mechanics and optimization:

- **Energy Minimization**: Code to minimize the energy of an Ising lattice using:
  - A **greedy algorithm** for basic optimization. One of the problems with this method is that the lattice can get stuck in a local minimum.
  - **Simulated annealing** for a more robust approach to escape local minima.
- **Metropolis Algorithm**: Implementation to simulate the Ising model dynamics, producing a visual **GIF** of the lattice evolution. This gif shows my metropolis implementation at a low temperature.

More methods and visualizations will be added in future updates!
