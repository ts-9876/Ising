# Spin Glass Simulations and Ising Model

This repository contains an implementation of a graph neural network that searches for the ground states of spin glasses and an implementation of Metropolis. 

**AI Optimization**: Graph neural network meant to optimize 2D EA spin glasses with Gaussian-distributed couplings.

**Metropolis Algorithm**: Implementation to simulate Ising model dynamics, producing a visual **GIF** of the lattice evolution. This gif shows my metropolis implementation at a low temperature.
