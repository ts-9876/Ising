# Ising Model and Spin Glass Simulations

This repository contains computational implementations of the Ising model and a graph neural network that searches for ground states of spin glasses. 

**Metropolis Algorithm**: Implementation to simulate Ising model dynamics, producing a visual **GIF** of the lattice evolution. This gif shows my metropolis implementation at a low temperature.

**AI Optimization**: Graph neural network meant to optimize 2D EA spin glasses with Gaussian-distributed couplings.
